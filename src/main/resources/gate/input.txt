ORGANIZATION STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

This paper is aimed at providing answers to the list of research questions on the subject of the strategic analysis of the company. Within the framework of these questions there was developed the following theoretical purpose of the current proposal: to structure the available data on the strategic analysis in context of the strategic management. The above issue is addressed in the 5 following parts of the article:
1) Introduction 
2) Literature Review
3) Methodology
4) Results Anticipated
5) Conclusion
The first part of the proposal provides explanation of the research questions and the main purpose of the study, states delimitations, indicates the professional significance and presents the definitions of key terms. The second part of the proposal introduces the theoretical and practical background of the study. The third part represents a sort of practical recommendations for strategic analysis of a firm. The fourth part of the proposal presents the possible results of the practical part of our study. And the last part is the findings of current paper.


Introduction
Background of the study. Market economy is very unstable phenomenon. It is based on consumer demand, rather than at a pre-approved plan. The former can vary depending on external and internal environment of the organization. Therefore, when it becomes difficult to predict a certain possible market trends, superiors use the strategic management (Fleisher, Bensoussan, 2003). It helps company to adapt to a rapidly changing environment, as well as indicates company�s weaknesses, which can also be changed. The latter can be achieved with the help of strategic analysis.
Today specialists adhere to quite various views and approaches about the role of strategic management. But in spite of numerous works on the subject of strategic management there is a very few clear data regarding the role of strategic analysis within this process. Not all experts distinguish it as a separate unit, which is suitable for the study.
Technology and methodology of strategic analysis is also has always been a controversial issue. Strategic analysis includes a variety of tools for its realization. But researchers in their works always offer different variants of most effective combination of existing tools. 
Problem statement. Taking into account an existing background, it is possible to identify a number of problems in the area of strategic analysis. These problems can be formulated as the following questions:
What place in the structure of strategic management is given to strategic analysis?
What is the primary role of strategic analysis?
What is the reason for variability of toolsets of strategic analysis?
What are the rules for using strategic analysis tools more effectively? 
The main purpose of this paper is contained within these research questions. In the current project my research interest will centre on structuring the available data on the strategic analysis and developing a sort of recommendations for strategic analysis of a firm. Moreover I am going to apply received data and recommendations to strategic analysis of the real firm.
Delimitations of the study. I am going to limit the findings of this study by the theoretical framework. I will consider the concept of strategic analysis only in terms of its main purpose and its place in the structure of strategic management.
The further limitations will be provided by the date of considered researches. I am going to analyze the works that have been published no earlier than in 1990. 
Finally, the limitations will affect my recommendations. Im not going to write about certain methods (tools) of strategic analysis. The recommendations will consist only of the generalized rules of tools application.
Professional significance. As mentioned earlier understanding and defining the concept of strategic analysis varies between different scholars. The role of strategic analysis in the context of organizational management as well varies. Because of it, in the framework of my project a number of specific aims to achieve will be consisting in comparison of existing views on discusses problem. It seems relevant to differentiate entities in a rank order of some classify, for example according to relations with strategic management.  In the literature the concept of strategic analysis is not considered in such a context. 
Moreover, as the result of this research I am going to received a number of recommendations for strategic analysis tools application. This set can be applied in any practice including the company on the example of which I am going to carry out a strategic analysis to increase its profit.
Definitions of key terms. Because of the terminological ambiguity in the considered area, an appropriate explanation of a particular term can not be given. But during the paper I will outline the main directions of interpretation of key terms.
Literature Review 
The following literature review is aimed at overview the understanding and definition of the concept of the strategic analysis among the various authors. In the work of each author I am going to emphasize two following aspects:
1) The strategic analysis position in the structure of strategic management;
2) The main purpose of the strategic analysis.
Clark D. (Clark, 1997) defines the strategic analysis as one of the phrases which is used in the process of strategic management. Altogether he has identified the following phases: situation assessment, strategic analysis and strategic implementation. His model is also included 32 strategic tasks grouped according to a these phases. Table 1
Table 1
Three-Phase Strategic Management Process Model


Considering the �three-phase strategic management process model� only in terms of strategic analysis is not difficult to note that its main task is work with alternative strategies. Thus, the strategic analysis phase in Clark�s model, includes three following actions: generation of strategic alternatives, evaluation of strategic alternatives and selection of a specific strategy.
Johnson, Scholes and Whittington (Johnson, Scholes, Whittington, 2008) also noted the direct link between strategic analysis and evaluation of alternative strategies. The understanding of the concept of strategic analysis, the authors provide with the help of differentiation of the two following management functions: determination the main strategy tasks and development of the alternative strategies. Determination the main strategy task is a result of deep managers discussions. And according to Johnson, Scholes and Whittington is important to understand that there is no special strategic tool for this purpose. In contrast evaluation of alternative strategies is a complex process which requires a set of certain strategic tools. In this way according to Johnson and his colleagues, the main task of the strategic analysis is the creation of alternative strategies of firm development.
But at the same time, not all foreign researchers note the development of alternative strategies as a priority of strategic analysis. Wootton, S. and Horne T. (Wootton, Horne, 2010) mark only an indirect connection between these concepts. The authors propose a model of strategic management process, which is represented in 9 steps in frameworks of 3 following stages: the strategic analysis, the choice of strategic direction (alternative) and the implementation of the chosen strategy. The following table shows all the steps grouped in the stages.

Table 2
The Strategic Management Process  

Analyzing the table, it is easy to note that the main task of strategic analysis is the work with the external and internal environment of the organization instead of the development of alternative strategies, which presented in the last stage. 
Russian specialist offers a similar model of strategic management. Markova V. (�������, 2012) allocates the following 4 steps in the management process: 
1) Setting objectives;
2) Analysis of gaps, that containing an assessment of the internal and external environment;
3) Choosing a strategy taking into account the consideration of alternatives;
4) Implementation of the chosen strategy.
It is obvious that the strategic analysis is used in the second stage, and its task is to analyze the internal and external environment.
Another Russian writer Horin A. (�����, 2006) also does not puts the developing of alternative strategies as the only task of strategic analysis. In his works, he noted that strategic management of is a set of functions, the most important of which is the making of management decisions. This function can be divided into the three following stages: the information support, the analytical support and the decision making itself. And according to Horin A. the strategic analysis is located in the middle between functions of data collection, data processing and decision making. In other words, in this concept the strategic analysis is a kind of filter through which passes all the information before making a management decision.  Horin A. finds that the main task of strategic analysis is to provide an objective data on the general state of organization, on the state of its divisions, on the trends and patterns of its development. Development of alternative strategies the author presents as a separate management function.
Strategic analysis of the company is the process of creating a strategy that based on evaluation of the organizations resources. This definition of strategic analysis belongs to another Russian expert Basovskyi L. (���������, 2014).  He considers that the resources are the unique context that distinguishes the organization among others, and has a profound effect on the formation of strategy. Basis of this approach is the necessity of comprehensive understanding of the company its resources and capacities. For this purpose the strategic analysis will be useful. In such a way Basovskyi L. considers that the main tasks of the strategic analysis are the collection and evaluation the data about the organization�s resources.
After considering the views of some experts, it is possible to note two trends in the understanding of the concept of strategic analysis. They are the following:
1) Foreign experts often note that the only purpose of the strategic analysis is to develop and analyze alternative strategies.
2) Some foreign and most of Russian specialists believe that the main purpose of the strategic analysis is the study of the external and internal environment of organization, to provide the objective information about the situation of company in the market. 
However, there are exist some specific ways of understanding the concept of the strategic analysis too. But most of them are the kind of the second trend, where the analysis carried out within the specific criteria. For example in the model of Basovskyi L. this criterion are organization�s resources, which are the functional element of the internal environment of the organization. In such a way according to Basovskyi L. the strategic analysis held within the internal organizational environment.
Of course, this is not a complete description of this theoretical aspect of the topic. There are many other concepts that were not considered. Nevertheless, the information from the current literature review will be enough to conduct research and to interpret results in a right way.
Further in this paper, the term strategic analysis we are going to understand as a study of the enterprise environment. This process requires the appropriate technology and tools, which we are going to describe in the following part of the paper.
Methodology
In previous part of the proposal I have already described the various concept of the strategic analysis, divided them into groups and selected one the most suitable for this paper. In this part of the research I will focus my attention across the following question: How to use the tools of strategic analysis more effectively?
In the process of choosing methods (tools) for the strategic analysis, it is important to remember features of the company that is analyzed. Enterprises are very diverse in their possibilities and goals. Some have one employee and are established in the same building where the owner lives; others are multinational companies with several thousands of employees. It is obvious that such a situations calls for diversification of methods of strategic analysis.
A lot of managers consider that the most multipurpose tool is a SWOT-analysis. This tool can identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of an organization. On the one hand it is really a very good tool, because it gives opportunity to analyze internal and external sides of company both separately and in correlation. But most specialists underestimate the complexity of that method and use it in very general way. They often forget that there exist a lot of other methods to analyze internal and external organization environment. Such as Porter Five Forces analysis for external environment or Business Model Canvas analysis for the internal environment. But using them one after another is inefficiently too. Tools become more powerful only if to use them together in connection.  For example, in case when it used both SWOT-analysis and Porter Five Forces analysis, it is necessary to make SWOT-analysis to each of 5 forces.
Many of the modern researchers consider that strategic analysis is not valid without competitor analysis. And it is seems to be true because with no information about competitors it is impossible to know in which direction to develop, what strategy is better to choose. 
Results Anticipated
In the practical part of this study some complex relationships will be presented in terms of specific research question. Specifically there will be carried out a strategic analysis of the particular company. The material to be obtained will show correlation between the firm�s characteristics and their impact on profit. Strategic analysis tools will used in connection with each other and will be also apply to competitors. Because of it results of the analysis will be rather accurate. Moreover this text will be partly integrated with tables and figures that make it easier for interpret. So, to talk about the results in accurately and objectively way is possible only after practical part of current proposal, but suggestion of possible outcomes now help us to denote the direction of future work.
Conclusion
Examined the concept of strategic analysis from all necessary sides, I can sum up some findings. First of all, it is worth to mention that position of strategic analysis in framework of strategic management structure is always varies with different authors. But despite that the understanding its purpose can be divided into two following groups: 
1) Create and develop alternative strategies; 
2) External and internal analysis of organization environment.
In context of the current paper I decided to adhere to the second variant of interpretation, not only because such interpretation is widespread among Russian scholars, also because this concept better reflects the practical purpose of my research. 
I would also like to underline that the reason of diversification of strategic analysis methods is unique differences between companies. There are private and multinational companies, those who wish to receive a huge profit and those whose purpose to serve society and so on. Different companies require different methods, but even correctly a selected tool does not mean the success in the analysis. Only the set of tools using together in connection can be really powerful. Also this set should be used and for the competitors in order to compare the results and choose the right direction for further development.
